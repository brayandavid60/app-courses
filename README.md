# AppCurso

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## CORS Error

I recommend using **[Moesif Orign & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)**, it helps solve the CORS problem; In addition, it is necessary to view the content of the application.
